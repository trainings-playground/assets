This VM is configured to communicate with a real SKS cluster (Exoscale Mamanged Kubernetes) as you will see later in the exercise.\n\n## Sample application\n\nThis sample application is a simple web server written in javascript and which will thus run with NodeJS.\n\nFirst we create a folder dedicated to this application\n\n```command:host\nmkdir /app\ncd app\n```\n\nNext we copy the source code of our sample app inside that folder:\n\n```file:host:app.js\nconst express = require('express\u2019);\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\napp.get('/', (req, res) => { \n    res.send('Hello World!\u2019);\n});\napp.listen(port, () => {\n    console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nNodeJS needs to be installed (it is installed on your host VM) then the app can be run with the following command:\n\n```command:host\nnode app.js\n```\n\nIn command line you can access the application with a simple curl\n\n```commmand:host\ncurl localhost:3000\n```\n\n## About running the app on a standard VM\n\nThe previous steps show how easy it is to run web-based applications, but they also illustrate some kind of complexity regarding the management of the dependencies. You need to install NodeJS beforehand, in addition you also have to use the proper versions of the software components in place and take care of all dependencies (runtime environments, libraries, ...) for the application to run properly.\n\nIf you want to install the application on a Linux host (for instance an Ubuntu VM) you need to perform quite a lot of steps actually:\n\n- install dependencies on the Linux host\n- get the application repository\n- install the NodeJS interpreter\n- install the dependencies of the application\n- and finally run the application\n\nIf you want to run the same application on another host (Fedora, ...) some of the commands might be slightly different so this is not easily portable.\n\n## Running the app in a container\n\nLinux containes exist since quite some time, but Docker made then available to everyone a couple of years ago only. They are a great way to run processes in an isolated way and to package them in Container Image.\n\nIn order to package the application in a container image, you first need to write a Dockerfile, this one defines a set of instructions which details what the image contains.\n\nLet's create a simple Dockerfile to package the application defined above.\n\nFirst we indicate the base image our image will be based on:\n\n```\nFROM node:16-alpine\n```\n\nnext we install additional software\n\n```\nRUN apk add --no-cache python g++ make\n```\n\nand create and use the directory /app inside the container\n\n```\nWORKDIR /app\n```\n\nnext we copy everything where the Dockerfile is in, into the container under /app:\n- 1st parameter: local directory (./ is the directory where the Dockerfile is)\n- 2nd parameter: target directory inside the container\n\n```\nCOPY . .\n```\n\nnext we install the application dependencies (using npm for our nodejs application)\n\n```\nRUN npm install\n```\n\nthen we specify the command to run the application (to run a container based on the image)\n\n```\nCMD [\"node\", \"src/index.js\"]\n```\n\nLet's copy the above content into a file named Dockerfile:\n\n```file:host:/app\nFROM node:12-alpine\nRUN apk add --no-cache python g++ make\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm install\nCMD [\"node\", \"src/index.js\"]\n```\n\n## Build & Run\n\nOnce a Dockerfile is defined for our application, we build the image:\n\n```command:host\ndocker image build -t app:1.0 .\n```\n\nnext we can run a container based on the image\n\n```command:host\ndocker run -d -p 8080:8080 app:1.0\n```\n\nNote: docker has many commonly used flag, -d runs the container process in backagroud, -p map a container port with a port on the host machine\n\n## Distributing the image\n\nOnce the image is created, we need to publish the image to a registry so it can be used by other users. The DockerHub is probably the more famous registry out there even if many solutions exist (both as SaaS or to be installed on-prem).\n\nWe will not go into the process of publishing the image to your own \nregistry's repository here (as you would need to create your own DockerHub account first).\n\nFor this exercise, the image created above has already been published to the DockerHub. It is available as the techwhale/app:1.0 image. \n\nSummary: we have defined a sample application, packaged that one into a container image and have this image available in a registry. In the next step we will introduce Kubernetes and run the image in that orchestration solution.\n\n## From Docker to Kubernetes\n\nIf you want to scale all the container benefits to an entire IT environment, you need additional functions to coordinate, scale, manage, and automate. For example, taking containerized applications from your local machine to your local server can be done without additional help.\nStill, if you want to do this with 10, 100, or even 1000 applications and start distributing the workloads, clustering them for higher availability and stability in operations to serve the 24/7 demands of today's customers, you need additional help. This help for containerized applications is Kubernetes. This help for a scaleable, available, and more flexible infrastructure is Exoscale.\n\n## Overview of the architecture of a  Kubernetes cluster\n\n## Basic commands on Kubernetes\n\nBasic Commands\nTo get a feeling for this new world, lets have a look at some simple applications of the kubectl command.\n\nGet the client and server versions:\n\n```terminal:host\nkubectl version\n```\n\nList the cluster's nodes:\n\n```terminal:host\nkubectl get nodes\n```\n\nList the running pods:\n\n```terminal:host\nkubectl get pods\n```\n\n## Simple examples\n\nSimple Examples\nLet's look at two examples. First, a simple hello-world container and second, a simple ubuntu container.\n\nsimple hello-world container\n\n```terminal:host\nkubectl run ...\n```\n\nsimple ubuntu container\n\n```terminal:host\nkubectl run test -i --rm --tty --image=ubuntu -- bash\n```\n\n## Running our sample application" };
